   **🤔 Why Nitro?**  
   Our nitro-infused beverages are designed to captivate both the palate and the eye. By injecting nitrogen into each drink, we achieve a naturally creamy texture without additives, while the mesmerizing cascading effect turns every pour into a social media moment. Nitrogen also enhances flavor profiles, softening bitterness in coffee and tea while letting ingredients like Thai tea spices or ceremonial-grade matcha shine. With zero added sugar, these drinks cater to health-conscious customers while positioning the café as a hub for innovative beverage experiences.

## ✨ **Optional Add-Ons**  

### 🥂 **Alcohol**  
- **Local Craft Beer** (Rotating taps)  
- **Sparkling Wine** (By the glass)  
\
   **🤔 Why Alcohol?**  
   Alcohol is positioned as a strategic add-on, not a focus. Local craft beer and sparkling wine appeal to evening crowds seeking a relaxed vibe, requiring minimal storage or prep compared to a full bar. Curated pairings—like a hoppy IPA with spicy wraps—enhance the dining experience without complicating operations.  

### 🍦 **Sweet Treats**

- **Portuguese Custard Tart** (Flaky pastry + cinnamon custard)  
- **Nitro Affogato** (Soft serve + nitro coffee shot)  
\
   **🤔 Why Optional Sweets?**  
   Desserts like matcha soft serve and Portuguese custard tarts serve as indulgent finishers or standalone treats. The Nitro Affogato—a hybrid of our core nitro coffee and creamy soft serve—bridges categories, creating a signature item. Vibrant colors and photogenic presentation make these sweets Instagram naturals, driving organic social buzz.  

### 🍜 **Quick Comfort**  
- **Global Cup Noodles** (Japanese Miso Ramen, Korean Kimchi Noodle, Vegan Curry Laksa)  
- **Toppings Bar** (Soft-boiled egg, scallions, chili oil)  
\
   **🤔 Why Cup Noodles?**  
   Global cup noodles offer a warm, comforting option with almost zero kitchen effort. Premium instant varieties like Japanese miso ramen or vegan laksa align with the café’s travel-inspired theme, while a toppings bar (soft-boiled eggs, chili oil) lets customers customize their bowl. Paired with nitro drinks, they create cozy combos perfect for rainy days or late-night cravings.
