## ✨ **Optional Add-Ons**  

### 🥂 **Alcohol**

- **For Chr!st's Sake** (Sak.ee, Makko.li, Shoc.hu) \
\
   **🤔 Why Alcohol?**  
   Alcohol is positioned as a strategic add-on, not a focus. Local craft beer and sparkling wine appeal to evening crowds seeking a relaxed vibe, requiring minimal storage or prep compared to a full bar.

   Desserts like matcha soft serve and Portuguese custard tarts serve as indulgent finishers or standalone treats. The Nitro Affogato—a hybrid of our core nitro coffee and creamy soft serve—bridges categories, creating a signature item. 

### 🍜 **Quick Comfort**  
- **Global Cup Noodles** (Japanese Miso Ramen, Korean Kimchi Noodle, Vegan Curry Laksa)

   **🤔 Why Cup Noodles?**  
   Global cup noodles offer a warm, comforting option with almost zero kitchen effort.
